Pico party. It will wait until the lights go dim, light its fake flickery candle and play happy birthday on its tiny buzzer.

# Components
- Raspberry pi pico
- 220 ohm resistor
- Yellow LED
- Buzzer
- Photoresitor

Solder the componets directly to the board (see photo). Copy the code to a file called `main.py` at the root directory of the pico.
